    "### Why learn Visualization?\n",
    "- 􏰏Visualization allows people to understand and extract information faster and with more accuracy than displaying text and numbers.\n",
    "- A good visualization makes data more understandable and reachable to more people.\n",
    "- High quality visualization encourages confidence in the data analysis and inspires people to utilize the data more effectively.\n",
    "􏰏\n",
    "### What is Data Visualization? What is Tableau?\n",
    "Data visualization is the creation and presentation of visual representations of data with the goal to communicate information clearly and efficiently.\n",
    "􏰏 - Data visualizations include graphs, charts, images, plots, and tables.\n",
    "􏰏 - Data visualization is both an art and a science as it relies on both scientific data analysis and techniques as well as artistic creativity and presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Tableau</b> is a software package designed to make data visualization easy for non-expert users.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Data Visualization with Previous Tools\n",
    "􏰏\n",
    "- We have seen data visualization in a variety of other tools including Excel, Python, and R.\n",
    "- We saw how we could call to different packages to enhance visualization capabilities and improve the program’s base ability to effectively communicate the information to end users and increase simplicity in creating the visualizations.\n",
    "- Each program has it’s advantages and disadvantages and there is no one perfect software package for data visualization as you must trade-off experience, time, and appearance.\n",
    "􏰏\n",
    "### Data Visualization with Excel\n",
    "- In Excel, we saw examples of charts including pivot charts, sparklines, and visual formatting of cells.\n",

    "Figure: Examples of quantitative data visualizations using R\n",
    "\n",
    "- The last two slides demonstrate how the importance of the type of data being inputted into our graphics.\n",
    "- Namely the collection of graphs we could create with qualitative data is different from the collection of graphs we could make with quantitative data.\n",
    "- Tableau is a very powerful tool for data visualization, that will do a lot of the heavy lifting and allow us to gain deeper insights into our data.\n",
    "- Tableau will help us guide us along the way by segregating qualitative from quantitative fields and provide suggestions on useful types of graphics depending on the inputted fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Tableau\n",
    "􏰏 - [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com) was founded in 2003 as a spin-off from Stanford University by Chris Stolte, Christian Chabot and Pat Hanrahan.\n",
    " - The goal of Tableau is \"to help people see and understand their data.\" - Christian Chabot, Tableau CEO\n",
    "􏰏        - General goal: make less unknown and more known.\n",
    "􏰏        - Graphical representation of data can allow us to see patterns\n",
    "           that we may not necessarily see by examining the raw data.\n",
    "  - Tableau has desktop and server (enterprise) products as well as Tableau Public allowing sharing of data sets.\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "􏰏- We will be using the desktop version of [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students)\n",
    "- Visit [this](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students) site to obtain a license or to view examples of its use.\n",
    "- We will be working with the Superstore data sets (Global Superstore Returns 2016.csv and Global Superstore Orders 2016.xlsx).\n",
    "- The quickest way to download this data is to click the “Getting Started\" video located on Tableau home page or here (you will need to register and sign in before you can see the videos).\n",
    "􏰏\n",
    "### Tableau Home page\n",
    "\n",
    "![Kiku](../images/11Visualization/home.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Home Page Tableau\n",
    "􏰏\n",
    "- On the right hand panel of the Home page, you will notice a series of instructional videos.\n",
    "- These are a great resource to learn more about the features available in Tableau.\n",
    "- See the training videos which use the Superstore data sets\n",
    "􏰏    -  Global Superstore Orders 2016.xlsx\n",
    "􏰏    - Global Superstore Returns 2016.csv\n",
    "See finished workbook: getting_started_finished.twbx file\n",
    "- On the left hand panel, you will notice that there are several ways that we can connect with data:\n",
    "􏰏      - stored locally on our computer (eg. excel files, .csv) \n",
    "      - on a server (eg. MySQl)\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Home Page Tableau\n",
    "􏰏 􏰏\n",
    "- This requires that you have a license or trial key.\n",
    "- Students qualify for a free license through the Tableau for Students Program if currently enrolled at an accredited academic institution (undergraduate/post-graduate level).\n",
    "- The lab computers in SCI 234 should have Tableau installed (make sure you are using the latest version: Tableau 2019)\n",
    "- Sidenote: the Professional Version of Tableau is priced at $1,999 + maintenance fee per license.\n",
    "- There is also a free version of their software called [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Superstore data\n",
    "􏰏\n",
    "- This excel file contains two tabs (ie two worksheets):\n",
    "    - Orders which contains the products and transactions of\n",
    "      customers.\n",
    "    - People Customer information\n",
    "- To begin, we read this file into Tableau by navigating to the Home Page > Connect (left panel) > To a file > Microsoft Excel.\n",
    "- This will open a data source page, from which we can drag and add different data sources.\n",

    "- If we have related data in another data source, we can create an integrated data source by adding a connection, by clicking the “Add\" link in the top left corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, we can create a database-like JOIN with data from another source (eg. we can connect the Orders from Global Superstore Orders 2016.xlsx to the Returns from Global Superstore Returns 2016.csv)\n",

    "### Tableau Features\n",
    "   􏰏\n",
    "- Supported [data types](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/datafields_typesandroles_datatypes.htm): text , dates , numbers , geographical coordinates (latitude/longitude), Boolean\n",
    "- There are a number of aggregation functions available in Tableau: sum, average, max, count, variance, etc.\n",
    "- There are many built-in functions for numeric and string manipulation.\n",
    "- Calculated fields can be created and are proceeded by an equal sign:\n",
    "- Visualizations are created by dragging these fields (or “pills\") to desired shelves, . . .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tableau Terminology\n",
    "A pill is a field (i.e column in your data set) that can be placed in the visualization. The are stored one of two [field types](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/datafields_typesandroles.htm)\n",
    "<b>Dimension</b>or categorical/discrete information are colour-coded using blue pills\n",
    "<b>Measures</b> , that is, metrics containing our quantitative information are colour-coded using green pills\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensions (eg. date, customer) are usually what is used for creating labels while the Measures (eg price) are the metrics we want to analyze (this data is often continuous).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tableau Terminology\n",
    "A shelf is a location to put a pill.\n",
    "􏰏 - Column shelf, row shelf, filter shelf\n",
    "􏰏 - Row and column shelves are similar to Pivot tables in Excel but with built-in visualization.\n",
    "Dragging pills to different shelves will change the way our graphics appears. To remove of undo a move, simple drag the pill off the shelf to delete, or press the undo button. The Clear Sheet button will erase the entire graphic\n",
    "\n",
    "![Kiku](../images/11Visualization/undo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tableau Workspace Items\n",
    "\n",
    "![Kiku](../images/11Visualization/workplaceitems.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### View Cards\n",
    "View or shape cards allows control of colour, shape, and size. They also enable filtering, labeling, and ability to add details on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Color</b> expresses discrete or continuous values\n",
    "- <b>Size</b> expresses discrete or continuous values\n",
    "- <b>Label</b> one or more fields can be expressed as label on marks\n",
    "- <b>Detail</b> disaggregates the marks plotted\n",
    "- <b>Tooltip</b> makes fields available to tooltips without disaggregating data (shows info when hovering)\n",
    "- <b>Shape</b> expresses discrete or continuous fields\n",
    "Multiple fields can be placed on the colour, label, detail, and tooltip buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Kiku](../images/11Visualization/sales.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "􏰏 - Notice how Tableau will guess at useful aggregations of our data.\n",
    "􏰏 \n",
    " - We can change these fields by clicking the pills located on each shelf\n",
    "􏰏 􏰏\n",
    "      - eg. change SUM to MEDIAN by Measure (Sum) > Median . \n",
    "      - eg. change the sales per year to sales per quarter or sales per month (see next slide for details)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we may want to see average sales month-to-month for each year.\n",
    "􏰏\n",
    "- Click the + sign to the Left of the blue pill, to granulate the dates into finer subcategories (ie. Quarters)\n",
    "- Drag year to the right of Quarter so that we see each quarter yearly (rather than each year quarterly)\n",
    "- Then drag year to ‘Color’ to change this side by side line graph to a single line graph with a legend.\n",
    "- Change Quarter to Month to get the next level of granularity for these dates\n",
    "- Click the downarrow on the green pill and change Measure (Sum) > Average.\n",

    "- Choose the desired dimensions and measures by selecting them with your cursor while holding down the Ctrl key (window) or Cmnd key (mac).\n",
    "- As your selections change, different chart types will be suggested for you (i.e. they will become highlighted) .\n",
    "- Think of Show Me as your one-click option that will automatically place pills on shelves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Show Me\n",
    "- Eg, since Country has a geographical component, a map seems like a natural choice:\n",

    "􏰏    - year, quarter, month\n",
    "􏰏    - country, state, city\n",
    "- We can create own hierarchies by dragging dimensions on top of each other.\n",
    "- For example, in the Superstore data, ‘Sub-category’ is a, for lack of better term, sub-category of ‘Category’.\n",
    "- To have Tableau recognize it as such, we simply drag the sub-category pill over-top of category (in addition, we could do that with product name).\n",
    "- We might name this new pill ‘Product’.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User made dimension\n",
