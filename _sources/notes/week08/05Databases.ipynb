    "## Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Relational Databases?\n",
    "*Relational databases* allow for the storage and analysis of large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases are the most common form of database used by companies and organizations for data management.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since a significant amount of data is stored in relational databases, understanding how to create and query these databases using the SQL standard is a very valuable skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a database?\n",
    "A **database** is a collection of logically related data for a particular domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "To manage (query, monitor, etc.) your database you need a tool. . .\n",
    "\n",
    "A **database management system (DBMS)** is software designed for the creation and management of databases.\n",
    "- e.g. Oracle, DB2, Microsoft Access, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, LibreOffice Base, . . .\n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom line: A **database** is the *data* stored and a **database system** is the *software* that manages the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Databases in the Real World\n",
    "Databases are everywhere in the real-world even though you do not often interact with them directly. $40 billion dollar annual industry\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Retailers manage their products and sales using a database. e.g. Wal-Mart has one of the largest databases in the world!\n",
    "- Online web sites such as Amazon, eBay, and Expedia track orders, shipments, and customers using databases.\n",
    "- The university maintains all your registration information and marks in a database that is accessible over the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from these large enterprise-grade data stores, we could also create and store small database on our person computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database System Properties\n",
    "A database system provides efficient, convenient, and safe multi-user storage and access to massive amounts of persistent data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficient**: Able to handle large data sets and complex queries without searching all files and data items.  \n",
    "**Convenient**: Easy to write queries to retrieve data.  \n",
    "**Safe**: Protects data from system failures and hackers.  \n",
    "**Massive**: Database sizes in gigabytes, terabytes and petabytes.  \n",
    "**Persistent**: Data exists even if have a power failure.  \n",
    "**Multi-user**: More than one user can access and update data at the same time while preserving consistency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Relational Model: Terminology\n",
    "The **relational model** organizes data into tables called relations.  \n",
    "Developed by E. F. Codd in 1970 and used by most database systems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Terminology:  \n",
    "A **relation** is a table with columns and rows.  \n",
    "An **attribute** is a named column of a relation.  \n",
    "A **tuple** is a row of a relation (a single record in a table).  \n",
    "A **domain** is a set of allowable values for one or more attributes.  \n",
    "The **degree** of a relation is the number of attributes it contains.  \n",
    "The **cardinality** of a relation is the number of tuples it contains.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Relation Example\n",
    "The name of this relation is Emp.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/05Databases/databases.png\" alt=\"databases\" width=\"800\" >    \n",
    "Side note: Sometimes, the term **field** and **attribute** are used interchangeably, and for most purposes, they are the same thing. However,\n",
    "field describes a particular cell in a table found on any row, while attribute describes an entity characteristic in a design sense.\n",
    "[Source](https://www.lifewire.com/attribute-definition-1019244). Eg. A. Lee is a field while ename is the attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relation Practice Example\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/05Databases/dbq.png\" alt=\"dbq\" width=\"400\" >   \n",
    "**Example 5.1**  \n",
    "1. What is the name of the relation?\n",
    "2. What is the cardinality of the relation?\n",
    "3. What is the degree of the relation?\n",
    "4. What is the domain of resp? What is the domain of hours?\n",

    "### Creating and Using Databases\n",
    "Typically, a data analyst will use an existing database. The database will already be created on a database system and contain data that was inserted and updated previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use an existing database, the data analyst must be able to use the tools and languages to query the database. The standard is SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a large database is outside of the scope of this class, but we will learn how to create individual tables and load data into them which is a common data analysis task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Simple Query Language: Keyword Seaching\n",
    "A query on Google, for example, allows a user to type keywords or phrases and returns a best answer estimate.  \n",
    "<img src=\"../images/05Databases/google.png\" alt=\"google\" width=\"400\" > \n",
    "This works fairly well for web searches, although we lack precision. Precision is required for many applications.  \n",
    "> Example: How would you return all employees with salary greater than 30,000 using keyword search?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Overview\n",
    "**S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage or **SQL** is the standard database query language to retrieve *exact answers*.\n",
    "- Using simple, declarative *statements* (i.e. a valid command recognized by the database), SQL queries specifies what to retrieve while preserving the accuracy, security and integrity of the database.\n",
    "- SQL is used by Microsoft Access, LibreOffice Base, and almost all other database systems.\n",
    "- A knowledge of SQL commands will give you the power to access and explore data stored or relational databases.\n",
    "- There is a set of *reserved/key words* that cannot be used as names for database fields and tables. e.g. **SELECT**, **FROM**, **WHERE**, etc.\n",
    "- SQL is generally *case-insensitive*.\n",
    "- **SELECT** will be treated the same as **Select** and **select**<sup name=\"a1\">[1](#f1)</sup>\n",
    "- Some setups are case-sensitive for table and column, for example, ‘ENAME’ not the same as ‘ename’.\n",
    "- Linux MySQL: usually defaults to case-sensitive for table and column names\n",
    "- Windows: usually defaults to case-insensitive for table and column names\n",
    "- Note that LibreOffice Base converts unquoted fields and table names to upper case; more on this [here](https://eeperry.wordpress.com/2013/11/15/libreoffice-base-sql-creating-tables/).\n",
    "- SQL is *free-format* and white-space is ignored.\n",
    "- Statements always end in a semicolon ;  \n",
    "<b name=\"f1\">1</b> standard convention usually will capitalize keywords [↩](#a1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Create Table\n",
    "The `CREATE TABLE` **command/clause** is used to create a table in the database.\n",
    "- A clause/command performs a specific tasks in SQL. While clause will work with lowercase letters, the convention is to write command in capital letters.\n",
    "A table consists of a table name (eg. emp) and a set of fields/attributes with their names and data types (i.e. domain).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/05Databases/createTab.png\" alt=\"createTab\" width=\"700\" >   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Create Table - Constraints\n",
    "- The NOT NULL is a *constraint* which indicates that we can not enter a tuple into this relation without the field ename\n",
    "- To put another way, all employees in the employee table must be entered with an employee name (makes sense!)\n",
    "- Other constraints include:  \n",
    "**UNIQUE** forces all rows to have a different value.  \n",
    "**DEFAULT** sets the field to a certain value if it is not specified,   \n",
    "**eg.** DEFAULT 0 or DEFAULT ’unknown’  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a key?\n",
    "A **key** is a set of attributes that *uniquely* identifies a tuple in a relation. Read more about this constrain [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_primarykey.asp)\n",
    "- A *primary key* uniquely identifies a record in the table.\n",
    "- A table can have only *one* primary key; however it can consist of single or multiple columns (fields).\n",
    "- A *foreign key* is a field in a table that is primary key in another table.\n",
    "Although keys are not required, they can help to identify a particular row (data item) and find it faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the emp table, the key was eno. It was called the primary key because it was the main key used to find an employee in the table.\n",

    "\n",
    "- We will learn how to code SQL queries.\n",
    "- Queries offer the ability to retrieve and filter data, calculate summaries (totals), and update/move/delete records in bulk.\n",
    "- We also may want to take advantage of the graphical user interface (GUI) frontend for data manipulation and queries.\n",
    "- These visual representations are easy to use and hides the complexity of writing SQL commands while still providing access to powerful and advanced analysis\n",
