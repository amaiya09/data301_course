### Course Format
- Each lecture will be posted on [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/).
- I encourage you to print them out/follow along with them on your computer.
- If possible, it will be beneficial that you download the necessary programs prior to lecture so that you can follow along with examples on your laptop.


### Email
I check email twice a day, once in the morning and once in the late afternoon. Emails will be answered in order of importance and
when they were received. In order to ensure a reasonably prompt response all Emails should use the following format:
- Subject line must begin with the course subject, eg. DATA 301 (or COSC 301 or DATA 501)
- The first line of the email you will state your name, student number and the course code as stated in the subject line.
Before e-mailing me, I encourage you to ask questions on Canvas’ Discussion Board.


### Labs
- Labs are held weekly starting next week.
- Please check your registration to determine your lab section and time.
- TAs will be in the lab each week to help with labs assignments and to provide help with general course material questions.
- While labs are not mandatory, you are highly encouraged to attend.
- You must be enrolled in a lab and you must only attend the lab you are enrolled in.
- While you will have access to University computers in the lab (all of the needed software should already be installed) feel free to bring in your laptops instead.


### Assignments
- Lab assignments are worth 30% (if enrolled in Data 301/Cosc 301) of your overall grade.
- Lab assignments may take more than the schedules lab time.
- Late assignments will have 10% deducted for each day (which includes weekends) beyond the due date. Assignments that are more than 5 days overdue will not be accepted.
- An assignment may be handed in any time before the due date.
- Assignments are critical to learning the material and are designed to prepare you for the exams and build up your skills!
- Please attend lab to go over any errors you made with your TA. Assignment solutions will not be posted.
- Lab assignments are done individually or in groups of two depending on the assignment.
- You are not bound to your partner and may choose to go solo on some or all of the subsequent assignments.
- Your partner need not be in the same lab section as you.
- If you are working with a partner, please decide on who will submit the documents to Canvas (only one person should upload these files).
- *Regardless* if you were the partner who uploaded the completed assignment, please include the name and student number of your partner in the **Assignment Comments**

### Academic Dishonesty
Cheating in all its forms is strictly prohibited and will be taken very seriously by the instructor.

> **Assignments** \
You are expect to submit original work done by you and acknowledge
all sources of information or ideas while attributing them to
others as required.

> **Exams** \
All exams are closed book, so no course materials should be
present.

### Academic Misconduct
Students are responsible for informing themselves of the guidelines of acceptable and unacceptable conduct for graded assignments
established by their instructors for specific courses, and of the examples of academic misconduct set out 
[here](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,959). Some main concerns include:
- Plagiarism, which is intellectual theft, occurs when an individual submits or presents the oral or written work of
another person as his or her own.
- Submitting the same, or substantially the same, essay, presentation, or assignment more than once (whether the
earlier submission was at this or another institution) unless prior approval has been obtained from the instructor(s) to
whom the assignment is to be submitted.


### Disciplinary Measures
Academic misconduct that is subject to [disciplinary measures](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,960).

Academic misconduct often results in a one-year suspension from the University and a notation of academic discipline on the
student’s record. However, disciplinary measures which may be imposed, singly or in combination, for academic misconduct
include, but are not limited to, the following:
- a failing grade or mark of zero on the assignment or in the course in which the academic misconduct occurred

Note that all incidents of suspected academic misconduct must be reported to the Dean’s Office.


### Academic Dishonesty
> **Don’t cheat!** \
Do not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.

- Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious
consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline.
- Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences. If you have any questions about how
academic integrity applies to this course, please consult with your professor.


### How to Pass This Course
The most important things to do to pass this course:

**Attend class and labs** 
- Follow along and annotate the lecture notes in class.
- Participate in class exercises and questions.
- Labs are for marks and are practice to learn the material for the exams.

To get an “A" in this course do all the above plus:
- Practice on your own. Practice makes perfect.
- Do more questions than in the labs. Try the techniques on your own data sets.


### Disclaimer
There is a wide variety in previous experience.
- Some material you may already know. Help others!!
- Build up your computer experience in labs and outside of class.
- Third-year standing means that you know how to “figure things out.”

The course will be very straightforward: Do the work and practice the techniques to do well.


### Systems and Tools
All required software is available on the lab computers in SCI 234.If you have your own personal laptop, it is advised that you download
the required software prior to class so that you can follow along with examples in lecture.
- Our first unit uses Excel. A student download of Microsoft office is available [here](https://it.ubc.ca/software-downloads)

Canvas will be used for accessing lectures, submitting assignments, posting marks, discussions, and more,. . .
- Support for students is available [here](https://canvas.ok.ubc.ca/2019/07/03/students/)


### The In-Class Quizzes
- To encourage attendance and effort, 5% of your overall grade is allocated to answering in-class clicker questions.
- These questions are answered electronically using a clicker.
- The clicker can be purchased at the bookstore.
- Please refer to the **ClickerOrientation** file uploaded to the **Supplementary Material** Canvas on how to use them.

### Clickers
- The clicker is personalized to you with your student number.
- At different times during all the lectures, questions reviewing material will be asked. Responses are given using clickers.
- You must answer 80% of the questions correctly to get the full 5%.
- There are some (not-for-grading) example clicker questions at the end of the lecture (I will take them up next class to ensure
everyone has a chance to obtain a clicker first)

### Don’t forget to register your clickers on Canvas

## An Introduction to Data Analytics

### Data Analytics vs Data Analytics
> **Data Analysis**\
*Data analysis* is the processing of data to yield useful insights or knowledge.

> **Data Analytics**\
*Data Analytics* is the science of examining raw data with the purpose of drawing conclusions about that information.

The distinction between data analysis and analytics is blurry to say the least 
(even [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics#Analytics_vs._analysis) is confused).\
[One source](https://www.getsmarter.com/blog/career-advice/difference-data-analytics-data-analysis/) 
might say that data analysis is a subcomponent of data analytics, while 
[another source](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Analytics-and-analysis-data-analytics) says data analytics is a subcomponent of data analysis.\
I like to think of data analysis as the method (ie action) whereas data analytics are tools used to do so.\
Analytics is supported by many tools such as Microsoft Excel, SQL, Python, R, all of which we will talk about in this course.


### Other related terms
Other terms that may add confusion to these definitions are . . .
- ***Data Science*** is a field comprised of everything relating to data cleansing, preparation, and analysis. This umbrella term that
encompasses data analytics, data mining, machine learning, and several other related disciplines.
- ***Big Data*** usually refers to immense volumes of data that inhibits the use of traditional data-processing applications.

See [this](https://www.simplilearn.com/data-science-vs-big-data-vs-data-analytics-article) article 
for more on the differences between Data Science, Big Data, and Data Analytics.


### What is a Data Analyst?
> **Data analyst** \
A *data analyst* is a person who uses tools and applications to transform raw data into a form that will be useful.

- Vital in a “data-driven” world with larger and more critical data sets.
- The first step in data analysis is often ***data collection/ munging/ processing*** which involves finding, loading, cleaning,
manipulating, transforming, and visualizing the data.
- The knowledge may be used for scientific discovery, business decision-making, or a variety of other applications.


### Why is Data Analytics important?
***Data analytics*** is important as society is collecting more and larger data sets all the time:

- **Web** All web pages visited and links clicked, searches made, images and posts
- **Business** Items purchased by date, supply chain/customers, industrial sensors
- **Science** Massive data sets (biological/genomic, astronomy, physics, healthcare)
- **Environmental** Sensors and monitors (temperature, etc.)

Transforming this raw data into useful insights has major value:
- **Web** Online advertising driven by understanding customer behaviour; 
[tailored google searches](https://microarts.com/insights/why-googles-search-results-vary-from-person-to-person/), 
[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/?authuser=0#/provision)
- **Business** [Sales predictions](https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/how-sales-teams-are-using-predictive-analytics), 
marketing promotions, manufacturing improvement
- **Science** Scientific discoveries, new medical treatments and drugs; see some [examples](https://www.datapine.com/blog/big-data-examples-in-healthcare/) in healthcare.
- **Environmental** Understanding of environmental processes to allow for changing policies and behaviours, 
eg [Institute of Environmental Analytics](https://www.the-iea.org/what-we-do/)


### Why This Course is Important?
- For many of you, this will be your first exposure to programming and data analytics.
- Regardless of your discipline, the tools you develop throughout this course will train you to think analytically and creatively.
- Beyond University, many professional jobs of the future will involve collecting, manipulating, and analyzing data.
- People who can understand how data can be used will have better employment opportunities.

Important skills you may learn in this course:
- Excel Proficiency: for general data analysis and productivity.
- Databases: Understand how they work and how to use them.
- Programming and Computational Thinking: Critical thinking and the ability to clearly articulate a problem in a systematic way has applications beyond data analytics.
- Applied Statistics: Using R and other software makes your statistics training useful for real-world problems.
- Data visualization: how to display and convey information in a meaningful way.
- Real-world problem solving: learn to tackle real-world data analysis problems and understand when to use what tool.


### Data Analytics Toolkit
- A data analyst has expertise in programming, statistics, data munging (transformation), and data visualization.
- In this course, you will be introduced to severals tools for gaining competency in each of these skills.
- As an introductory course, the goal is to get exposure to the skills and techniques as there will not be time for mastery.
- This toolkit of systems and techniques will be useful in many jobs even if they are not considered data analyst positions.

- Google processes about 3.5 billion requests/day and stores about 10 EB of data.
- Facebook collects 500 TBs/day (⇠2.5 billion items) and stores 100+ PB of photos.

See [here](https://web-assets.domo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/17_domo_data-never-sleeps-5-01.png) on how much data is generated every minute
- Users watch 4,146,600 videos every minute on YouTube
- Intagram users post 46,740 photos every minute.


### Types of Data Analysis
**Descriptive**: what are the features of the data? 

**Exploratory**: what new relationships/connections exist in the data?
> Correlation does not imply causation 

**Inferential**: use data samples to predict about larger population
> Statistical models: estimate value and uncertainty 

**Predictive**: use data to predict values for other objects 

**Causal**: what variables change values of other variables?
> Randomized studies: if give a drug/treatment, does it have a positive effect?
