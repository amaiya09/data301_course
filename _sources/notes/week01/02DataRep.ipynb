    "Using terminology precisely and correctly demonstrates understanding of a domain and simplifies communication.\\\n",
    "We will introduce terminology as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Computer Terminology\n",
    "- A **computer** is a device that can be programmed to solve problems.\n",
    "- **Harware** includes the physical components of computer\n",
    "    - (eg. central processing unit, monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, graphic card, speakers).\n",
    "- **Software** programs that a computer follows to perform\n",
    "functions\n",
    "    - (eg. operating system, internet browser).\n",
    "- **Memory** is a device which allows the computer to store data either temporarily (lost when computer reboots, eg.\n",
    "RAM) or permanently (data is preserved even if power is lost, eg. hard drive).\n",
    "- There are many different technologies for storing data with varying performance.\n",
    "- Some live inside your computer while others are portable and can be used on difference devices (e.g. USB drives).\n",

    "\n",
    "### “The Cloud”\n",
    "“The Cloud\" is not part of your computer but rather a network\n",
    "of distributed computers on the Internet that provides storage,\n",
    "applications, and services for your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- **Dropbox** is a cloud service that allows you to store your files on machines distributed on the Internet.\n",
    "Automatically synchronizes any files in folder with all your machines.\n",
    "- **iCloud** is an Apple service that stores and synchronizes your data, music, apps, and other content across Apple devices.\n",

    "### What is data?\n",
    "> **Data**: information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to\n",
    "help decision-making, or information in an electronic form that can be stored and used by a computer.\n",
    "– [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/data)\n",

    "However, is can be argued (see [this article](https://siliconangle.com/2014/03/05/data-does-not-equal-information-bigdatasv/) for example) that\n",
    "data &ne; information.\\\n",
    "In addition, on might refer to *raw* data as a collection of number/facts that don’t have meaning until it has been analyzed or has been given meaning.\n",

    "### How is data measured?\n",
    "- Computers represent data [digitally](https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/faculty/wolfe/book/Readings/Reading02.htm)\n",
    "meaning that data is represented using discrete units called as bits (Binary Digits).\n",
    "- The real-world is *analog* where the information is encoded on a continuous signal (spectrum of values, ie. infinite sounds/colours).\n",
    "> “Like with the artist’s abstract composition, the trick is to take all of the real-world sound, picture,\n",
    "number, etc. data that we want in the computer and convert it into the kind of data that can be\n",
    "represented in (on/off) switches.” – [University of Rhode Island](https://computing-concepts.cs.uri.edu/wiki/Data_Representation_For_Computing)\n",

    "1. Computers are digital and many home electronics are interfacing with computers.\n",

    "noise also makes it difficult to preserve the quality of analog signals across long distances.\n",

    "- A **binary number** is a number expressed using only 0s and 1s (ie. in the base-2 numeral system or **binary numeral system**).\n",
    "- Before discussing the binary system, let’s first discuss a conversion system you should all be familiar with: the **decimal system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decimal system uses digit placeholders, say ,  :white_large_square: , that can take on values from the set {0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9} \\\n",
    "The number of digits in the set is called the **base**. So the base for this system is 10.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Representing Data: Integers\n",
    "A binary system works in the same way, only now, the placeholder must take a value from the set {0; 1}.  \n",
    "To put another way, instead of using base 10 wherein:   \n",
    "ones=10<sup>0</sup>, tens=10<sup>1</sup>, hundreds=10<sup>2</sup>, thousands=10<sup>3</sup>, etc.  \n",
