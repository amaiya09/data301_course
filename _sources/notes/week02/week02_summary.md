## How this course is organized

Hello students! Welcome to Week 2 - this week we will dive right into the heart of the course and setup our machines for data analytics.

I will be adding a video about how this course is organized, soon.

## List of things to do this week

Below is a list of things you need to do this week, links to where you can do them, as well as roughly the order you should do it.
Note that these are just SUGGESTIONS and you are by no means required to them this way. 
I have put the labs at the end, but if your lab section is earlier in the week, you may want to shift things around.

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week02_task1" class="box"> [**Complete the lab**](./lab.md) </input></label>

```{tip}
You are highly encouraged (but not required) to attend labs this week (Lab 0). 

This week you can get help installing the programs for this course. The lab is OPTIONAL and if you are able to get all the install instructions completed, there is no need for you to attend the lab this week and there is nothing to turn in at the end.
```
<label><input type="checkbox" id="week02_task1" class="box"> [**Attend the Lecture**](./lab.md) </input></label>

```{tip}
Ideally you will come to the lecture this week with your GitHub.com account. That is the minimum (though it would be great if your computer was also set up!).
```

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week02_task2" class="box"> [**Watch the post-lecture videos**](./videos.md) </input></label>

```{tip}
After the lecture this week, I will post some additional videos for some additional context in preparation for next week's lab on Excel.
```

<label><input type="checkbox" id="week02_task3" class="box"> [**Write the Practice Test (60 mins)**](./test.md) </input></label>

```{tip}
This week's test is NOT for marks. It is only here so you can see how the testing system works (Canvas Quizzes) and make you more comfortbale with the testing system. 

The content of the course is on the course policies, and some other silly questions (again, not for marks).
