<h2>Is this syllabus a contract?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-this-syllabus-a-contract" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Rather than interpreting this syllabus as a legal document that serves as a contract between the instructor and the students, I prefer to view the syllabus as a <em>living document</em>.
Dr. John Warmer describes this best <a class="reference external" href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/syllabus-not-contract">in his article, “A syllabus is not a contract”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>… this syllabus is not a contract, it is a living document which reflects the experiences, emotions, philosophies, and goals I bring to a particular course.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>and also:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A syllabus as a plan is a lot like an itinerary before a trip.
There’s some definite highlights we need to hit, but if something that seems cool and worth doing crops up unexpectedly, we need to seize that opportunity in the moment.
If something really bad happens (the equivalent of a norovirus breakout on a cruise ship) we may need to abandon something previously scheduled entirely.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, it is worth noting that a recent review of legal precedents suggests that syllabi are not considered contracts by the courts <a class="bibtex reference internal" href="#rumore2016" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Having an adaptive and responsive syllabus is important to me as an instructor because it allows me to be more flexible with what/how/when you learn, and respond to your feedback in a meaningful way.
I invite you to be co-contributors to this syllabus, and use the tools provided to add your own annotations, questions, and suggestions on making this syllabus work for you.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>Please note that I have your best interests in mind, and it is highly unlikely that I will ever change a syllabus in a way that negatively affects the class, or even individual students. If you believe a syllabus change is affecting you negatively, please do not hesitate to reach out to me, or <a class="reference external" href="https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6FhZZZAe9WoKdnv">submit your feedback anonymously here</a>.</p>

<p>You should take this course to get an introduction to a very exciting field of data analytics!
In nearly every industry, the collection, analysis, and reporting of data is taking centre stage.
Very soon (if not already), computational literacy will be a foundational skill and this course will give you a taste of that world.
To show you the breadth and depth of careers available in data analytics, several recent graduates will be profiled and showcased.</p>
<p>Regardless of what your academic background is, you will find something interesting in this course.
DATA 301 is a very popular course in the department, and it gives students some important skills in programming, data science, data analysis, and communicating results effectively.
Though this is not an introductory programming course, we will make every attempt to make sure the content is accessible and interesting both to those that have prior computing experience, as well as those that don’t.
Pay close attention to the supplementary videos and articles that will be linked in the lecture notes if you need a primer on some of the concepts that we will only briefly cover.</p>

Briefly, this requires students to watch videos and engage with the assigned reading prior to the classroom meeting (knowledge transfer).
During the class meeting, the instructor guides students through clicker questions, worksheet problems, and other activities to help the students make sense of the material (sense-making).

<p>Accommodations are intended to remove barriers experienced by individuals with disabilities.
As a matter of principle, UBC is committed to promoting human rights, equity and diversity, and it also has a legal duty under the BC Human Rights Code to make its goods and services available in a manner that does not discriminate.
<a class="reference external" href="https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/files/2019/02/policy73.pdf">Policy 73</a> (Accommodation for Students with Disabilities) sets out principles and processes governing the accommodation of students with disabilities.</p>
<p>All accommodations for this course are handled through the <a class="reference external" href="https://students.ok.ubc.ca/academic-success/disability-resources/contact-the-disability-resource-centre/">Disability Resource Centre</a> and I encourage you to contact them to book an appointment.</p>

<p>Students who, because of unforeseen events, are absent during the term and are unable to complete tests or other graded work, should normally discuss with their instructors how they can make up for missed work.
If ill health is an issue, students are encouraged to seek attention from a health professional.
Campus Health and Counselling will normally provide documentation only to students who have been seen previously at these offices for treatment or counselling specific to conditions associated with their academic difficulties.
Students who feel that requests for consideration have not been dealt with fairly by their instructors may take their concerns first to the Head of the Department, and if not resolved, to the Office of the Dean (Email: fos.students.ubco&#64;ubc.ca).

I do not necessarily need to know all the personal details, just a high-level summary of your situation and what you think an ideal solution would be.</p>

<p>No problem! There’s not even any need to tell me, or ask for permission to miss deadlines.
The course is designed to give you maximum flexibility:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Every deadline has a 48-hour grace period that is automatically applied.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no late penalty if you use the grace period</p></li>
<li><p>You can use the grace period an unlimited amount of time in the course (though if it happens every week and for every assignment, I might check in with you and gently encourage you not to leave things to the last minute)</p></li>

If you’re going through something that is affecting you (course or otherwise), you are always welcome to come and talk to me about it.
If I am not able to help you myself, then I can probably direct you to the right person or resource.
If you need extra help, or extra time to deal with something you’re going through, just ask.
You will <em>never</em> owe me an explanation about your physical health, mental health, or those of your family members, friends, etc… I will believe you, and I will trust you.

I will do everything in my power to work out something that is both reasonable and fair.

<div class="section" id="how-do-i-go-through-this-course-ethically-and-with-integrity">
<h2>How do I go through this course ethically and with integrity?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-i-go-through-this-course-ethically-and-with-integrity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I want to be proud of your work in this course, and I want YOU to be proud of yourself as well!
That cannot happen if you make unethical decisions, including (but not limited) to cheating or plagiarism.
According to the scientific literature, the most common reasons students cheat are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fear of failure and life consequences</p></li>
<li><p>Peer pressure, including an inability to say no to help others cheat</p></li>
<li><p>Perceived societal acceptance of cheating (Lance Armstrong, Barry Bonds, Enron, Wall Street &amp; the The Big Short)</p></li>
<li><p>Desire for success without the time/desire to put in the work needed</p></li>
<li><p>Strict deadlines and due-dates</p></li>
<li><p>Requirement from instructors to memorize facts, figures, equations, etc…</p></li>
<li><p>High-stakes exams with no recompense for “having a bad day”</p></li>
<li><p>Peers cheating with no consequences or penalties</p></li>
<li><p>Unclear expectations on what constitutes academic dishonesty</p></li>
<li><p>Inadequate support from instructor and teaching team</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Though I sympathize with students and the stresses of your busy lives - in my opinion, there is no good reason to cheat.
I have tried extremely hard to make this course focused on learning rather than grading, and where grading is needed, to have policies that are as student-friendly as possible.
In particular, I hope (and expect) that the following features of the course should eliminate your temptation to cheat or plagiarize:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>48 hour grace-period on all homework and lab due dates and deadlines.</p></li>
<li><p>Long testing window (48 hours) so you can start the tests whenever you’re comfortable.</p></li>
<li><p>Timed tests have generous time limits (allowable time is 1.25x the estimated time).</p></li>
<li><p>Each test has a “bonus test” available one week later; for each test, we will take the better score of the pair.</p></li>
<li><p>No high-stakes exams (the single largest assessment item is the final exam at 25%).</p></li>
<li><p>All course assessments are completely open book and open notes.</p></li>
<li><p>Plenty of TA and instructor office hours and several outside of normal business hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Class website that outlines exactly what you should do when to help you manage your time.</p></li>
<li><p>Tonnes of supplemental materials including other instructional videos in case you want a different perspective.</p></li>
<li><p>Weekly prompt to accept the integrity pledge to keep you accountable.</p></li>
<li><p>A true willingness from the instructor (me) to help you learn and succeed in this course!</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>My personal plea<a class="headerlink" href="#my-personal-plea" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>With these features, and many other little things, I sincerely hope that you will consider completing this course with maximum integrity so that you never have to feel guilty, ashamed, or disappointed in yourself and your actions!</p>
<p>To make it even easier for you to decide what isn’t allowed, below is a list of things that I <strong>definitely</strong> consider to be academic dishonesty:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Asking others for their work in the course (whether question by question, or all at once)</p></li>
<li><p>Sending others your work in the course</p></li>
<li><p>Doing tests collaboratively (tests <strong>must</strong> be done by yourself and alone)</p></li>
<li><p>Sending others your test questions and/or answers</p></li>
<li><p>Sharing any course material onto Chegg, Course Hero, Slader, or other similar sites</p></li>
<li><p>Searching for solutions to course material on Chegg, Course Hero, Slader, or other similar sites</p></li>
<li><p>Blindly googling the question in hopes of finding someone who had a similar question and then copying their answer</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Note, googling to find resources to understand specific concepts or general ideas is highly encouraged!</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Having a tutor/friend/nemesis complete and submit your work for you</p></li>
<li><p>Copying and pasting code, equations, text explanations, prose, etc… without attribution</p></li>
<li><p>Manipulating the learning platforms we use to reverse engineer the randomization algorithms, hacking the timer functionality, or other similar technical <a class="reference external" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/malfeasance">malfeasance</a>.</p></li>

<h3>UBCO’s statement on Academic Integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#ubco-s-statement-on-academic-integrity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.
As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity.
At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required.
This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.
Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.
For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline.
Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.</p>

<h2>UBC Policies<a class="headerlink" href="#ubc-policies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence.
UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community.
Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom.
UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious and cultural observances.
UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.

<h3>Online learning for international students<a class="headerlink" href="#online-learning-for-international-students" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>During this pandemic, the shift to online learning has greatly altered teaching and studying at UBC, including changes to health and safety considerations.
Keep in mind that some UBC courses might cover topics that are censored or considered illegal by non-Canadian governments.
This may include, but is not limited to, human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender or sexuality, and historical or current geopolitical controversies.
If you are a student living abroad, you will be subject to the laws of your local jurisdiction, and your local authorities might limit your access to course material or take punitive action against you. UBC is strongly committed to academic freedom, but has no control over foreign authorities (please visit <a class="reference external" href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,293,866,0">this calendar page</a> for an articulation of the values of the University conveyed in the Senate Statement on Academic Freedom).
Thus, we recognize that students will have legitimate reason to exercise caution in studying certain subjects.
If you have concerns regarding your personal situation, consider postponing taking a course with manifest risks, until you are back on campus or reach out to your academic advisor to find substitute courses.
